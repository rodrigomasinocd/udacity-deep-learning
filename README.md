Take a course in neural networks and learn how to implement them using the PyTorch deep learning framework. Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurring networks for sequence generation, opposing generator networks for image generation and learn how to deploy accessible models from a website.


## Quick start

From the repository root, start the Notebook server with jupyter notebook.


## Contributions
This repository is mainly for my own purpose but I would be happy to share some thoughts with you. There are probably many ways to improve and tune the various neural nets.

To do so, just fork this repository.
